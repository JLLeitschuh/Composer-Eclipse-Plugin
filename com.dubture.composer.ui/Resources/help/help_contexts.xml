        <description>This page lets you configure the psr-0 namespace for your project. It will automatically map to the &quot;src&quot; folder in the root of your project.

By providing psr-0 compatible autoloading in your project, the composer plugin will be able to determine the namespaces for your classes automatically.</description>

      <description>The values contained in this page will be used to initialize a new composer.json file in the root of your project.

By default, the value from the &quot;Vendor name&quot; will be set as the psr-0 namespace, with the first letter capitalized - this can be customized on the second page of the wizard.

The PHP version selected on this page will be set as a requirement in your composer.json file.

During project creation, a composer.phar will be automatically downloaded from getcomposer.org, and &quot;composer.phar dumpautoload&quot; will be executed to initialize the autoloading of your project.</description>
